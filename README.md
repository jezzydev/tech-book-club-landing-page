## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive Web Design

### What I learned

I can replace a listâ€™s list style counter with an image. Some ways to do it are:

- Via list-style-image property.
- Via ::before pseudo-element, then assigning an image to the content property.
- Via adding a small-sized version of the image as a background image of the <li> element, positioning it at the far left where the counter should be. Then set a left-padding so the text will not overlap with the image. This seems hacky, but it worked.

```css
.features-list li {
  padding-left: 40px;
  background-image: var(--icon-check);
  background-position: 0 center;
  background-size: 28px 28px;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```

To put an image with customaziable width and height **over** a text (as in the ff screenshot)
![](./club_screenshot.png)

I can:

- Wrap the <img> element and the text in a <span>. Set the image's position to absolute and z-index to a higher number. The parent container should have its display set to inline-block.

```html
<span class="encircle-container"
  ><img class="encircle" src="./assets/images/pattern-circle.png" />club</span
>
```

```css
.encircle-container {
  position: relative;
  display: inline-block;
}

.encircle {
  position: absolute;
  width: 160px;
  height: 66px;
  z-index: 99;
  left: -18px;
}
```

### Continued development

@media queries for RWD
Efficient and effective way of creating and organizing CSS styles for reuse

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This helped me for any CSS properties whose syntax and/or usage I am not familiar with or may have forgotten.
